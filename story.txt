	When Mars Colonization was completed, and life on Earth came to an end in the year of 2103, humans believed that
the mankind was saved. Mankind was wrong. History repeated itself, and within 300 years
humans managed to deplete what mars had to offer. A small group of scientists working
in Mars Aeronautics and Space Administration (MASA), foresaw the upcoming disasters,
and they have prepared a contingency plan. This contingency plan was the colonization of Zephyros,
a planet named after the Greek God of West Winds, due to strong seasonal winds on the planet. This
planet was situated in Alta Galaxy. This meant saving the mankind was only possible through intergalactic voyage.
When the calendars hit March 1, 2411; the first group of astranauts left Mars in a spaceship, with the hopes of making
it to Alta Galaxy.
